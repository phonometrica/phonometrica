Meta-objects and inheritance
============================

Objects can be used to store key/value pairs. As such, they are a type of data structure known as associative arrays (or hash table, or sometimes dictionary). However, they have one additional feature which makes them particularly versatile: objects have a special field called ``meta``, which can store a reference to another object which acts as a *metaobject*. A metaobject is usually used to store specific behavior
shared by a set of objects of the same type.
