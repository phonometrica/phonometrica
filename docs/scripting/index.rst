Scripting
=========

Overview
--------

Phonometrica can be controlled and extended using a simple scripting
language. Scripting can be used in three ways:

-  Interactively, using the console at the bottom of the main window.
-  Creating scripts which can be saved and reused.
-  Creating :ref:`page-plugins`, which are extensions that can add features to Phonometrica.
