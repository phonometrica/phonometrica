Overview
========

Phonometrica is a free, open-source software platform for the annotation and analysis of speech corpora.
It offers a user-friendly interface to manage, annotate, analyze and query language corpora.
It is particularly well suited for dealing with time-aligned data. The main features it offers are:

   * Project management: organize files into projects.
   * Sound visualization and annotation: visualize and annotate speech sounds on multiple layers
   * Extensible metadata: annotate files with properties, which allow you to sort and organize your corpus.
   * Queries: build and save simple or complex queries; search strings or patterns across layers.
   * Data analysis: hypothesis testing, linear, logistic and Poisson regression
   * Scripting engine: Phonometrica can be configured and extended with an easy-to-use scripting language and JSON files.
   * Standard-based: Phonometrica files are encoded in XML and Unicode.
   * Interaction with Praat: Phonometrica can read and write TextGrid files and open files directly in Praat.

Phonometrica runs on all major platforms (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) and is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
The latest version can be downloaded from http://www.phonometrica-ling.org. If you have questions, problems, or would like to report a bug, please contact us at phonometrica.dev@gmail.com.
