Overview
========

Phonometrica is a free, open-source software toolbox for the analysis of speech data. It offers a user-friendly interface to manage, annotate and query language corpora. It is particularly well suited for dealing with time-aligned data. The main features it offers are:

   * Project management: organize files into projects.
   * Extensible metadata: files can be annotated with properties, which allow you to sort and organize your data.
   * Interaction with Praat: Phonometrica can read and write TextGrid files and open files directly in Praat.
   * Powerful search engine: build and save complex queries; search patterns across layers.
   * Standard-based: Phonometrica files are encoded in XML and Unicode.
   * Scripting engine: Phonometrica can be configured and extended with an easy-to-use scripting language.

Phonometrica runs on all major platforms (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) and is freely available under the terms of the CECILL license (version 2.1).
The latest version of Phonometrica can be downloaded from https://phonometrica.github.io. If you encounter any problem or bug, please write to the authors.
