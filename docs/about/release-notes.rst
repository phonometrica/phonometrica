Phonometrica is partly based on Dolmen, developed and maintained by Julien Eychenne from 2010 to 2018. A python
proof-of-concept of Dolmen was sketched out in April/May 2010. Dolmen was a complete redesign of the PFC
platform (2006/2008), a concordancer implemented in Python and specifically written for the PFC project
(www.projet-pfc.net).
