This is Kyle Gorman's original implementation of the SWIPE algorithm, but we made the following changes:

- the implementation was converted from C to C++
- we used the modified version of vector.c provided by SPTK, so that polynomial fitting doesn't require linking against LAPACK.
- we incorporated changes by Sevag Hanssian to replace FFTW with FFTS
