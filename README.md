Phonometrica is a free, open-source software platform for the annotation and analysis of speech corpora. 
It offers a user-friendly interface to manage, annotate and query language corpora. 
It is particularly well suited for dealing with time-aligned data. The main features it offers are:

* Project management: organize files into projects.
* Sound visualization and annotation: visualize and annotate speech sounds on multiple layers
* Extensible metadata: annotate files with properties, which allow you to sort and organize your corpus.
* Queries: build and save simple or complex queries; search strings or patterns across layers.
* Scripting engine: Phonometrica can be configured and extended with an easy-to-use scripting language and JSON files.
* Standard-based: Phonometrica files are encoded in XML and Unicode.
* Interaction with Praat: Phonometrica can read and write TextGrid files and open files directly in Praat.

Phonometrica runs on all major platforms (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) and is freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
